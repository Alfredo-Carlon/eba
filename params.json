  "body": "EBA is a prototype tool to find non-trivial resource manipulation bugs in C programs, at compile-time, and super-fast.\r\n\r\nIn its few months of existence, EBA has found several double-lock bugs in Linux 4.7--4.9 releases (i.e. in code that has passed code reviews). All the following bugs are caught by EBA in a matter of _seconds_:\r\n\r\n- [HSI: cmt_speech: Fix double spin_lock](https://github.com/torvalds/linux/commit/3c13ab1d96e1924ef73b1a20c1ccccc993b6fb58)\r\n- [usb: gadget: pch_udc: reorder spin_[un]lock to avoid deadlock](https://github.com/torvalds/linux/commit/1d23d16a88e6c8143b07339435ba061b131ebb8c)\r\n- [ath10k: fix deadlock while processing rx_in_ord_ind](https://patchwork.kernel.org/patch/9166323/) [1]\r\n- [net: ethernet: ti: cpdma: fix lockup in cpdma_ctlr_destroy()](https://github.com/torvalds/linux/commit/fccd5badb84de03fef9b072e7ae72fe0ea8348e3) [2]\r\n- [libceph: ceph_build_auth() doesn't need ceph_auth_build_hello()](https://github.com/torvalds/linux/commit/464691bd52b46a565153ec2a3b8b9984dacd4a00)\r\n- [[PATCH] Fix: scsi: megaraid: reduce the scope of pending-list lock to avoid double lock](http://www.spinics.net/lists/linux-scsi/msg100996.html)\r\n- [iommu/vt-d: Fix dead-locks in disable_dmar_iommu() path](https://github.com/torvalds/linux/commit/bea64033dd7b5fb6296eda8266acab6364ce1554) [3]\r\n- [Re: Potential double-lock BUG in drivers/tty/serial/sh-sci.c (Linux 4.9)](http://www.spinics.net/lists/linux-serial/msg24393.html)\r\n\r\n[1] I reported this bug in private email communication with Kalle Valo, but I was slow and the bug had been found and fixed already.\r\n\r\n[2] [I was slow at reporting this bug too.](https://github.com/torvalds/linux/commit/fccd5badb84de03fef9b072e7ae72fe0ea8348e3)\r\n\r\n[3] For some reason I was not credited, but [I reported this bug!](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/iommu/2016-September/018614.html)\r\n\r\n## How to get it?\r\n\r\nEBA is open source: [https://github.com/iagoabal/eba](https://github.com/iagoabal/eba)\r\n\r\n## Foundations\r\n\r\n- [A short 2-page paper about EBA (the evaluation results are outdated)](http://dl.iagoabal.eu/eba/short.pdf)\r\n- [A research paper to appear in VMCAI 2017](http://dl.iagoabal.eu/eba/vmcai.pdf)\r\n- [EBA's inference system for CIL](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/57892132/eba/cil.pdf)\r\n\r\n## Author(s)\r\n\r\nEBA is a tool by Iago Abal.\r\n\r\nThis project was part of my PhD at IT University of Copenhagen, under the supervision of Andrzej Wasowski and Claus Brabrand.\r\n\r\n",
