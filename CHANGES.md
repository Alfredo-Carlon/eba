EBA is a prototype bug-finder for C, originally developed by Iago Abal during his PhD at the IT University of Copenhagen (2013--2017).
This release is a cleaned up version of that very first research prototype.

A [VMCAI paper](http://dl.iagoabal.eu/eba/vmcai.pdf), and ultimately [Iago's thesis](https://pure.itu.dk/ws/files/83014638/PhD_Thesis_Final_Version_Iago_Abal_Rivas.pdf), elaborate on the theoretical foundations behind EBA.

Special mention to the Danish Council for Independent Research that funded this project, and to prof. Andrzej Wasowski and assoc. prof. Claus Brabrand who advised Iago during his 3-year PhD journey. Many thanks!
