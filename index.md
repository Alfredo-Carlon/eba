EBA is a prototype tool to find non-trivial resource manipulation bugs in C programs, at compile-time, and super-fast.

In its few months of existence, EBA has found several double-lock bugs in Linux 4.7--4.10 releases (i.e. in code that has passed code reviews). All the following bugs are caught by EBA in a matter of _seconds_:

[1] I reported this bug in private email communication with Kalle Valo, but I was slow and the bug had been found and fixed already.

[2] [I was slow at reporting this bug too.](https://www.spinics.net/lists/linux-omap/msg132214.html)

[3] For some reason I was not credited, but I reported this bug! Sometimes I reported [publicly](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/pipermail/iommu/2016-September/018614.html) and sometimes privately by emailing the maintainers.

## Installation

EBA is open source: [https://github.com/iagoabal/eba](https://github.com/iagoabal/eba)

(There are installation instructions in the README.md file.)

## Foundations

EBA first uses side-effect analysis to build a program abstraction. This abstraction is later model checked in search of bug patterns.
